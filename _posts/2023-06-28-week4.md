After talking to Prof Wu and Haneen, I realized that it wasn't clear from the queries I was timing if they were actually returning all of the data we desired. For instance, when running "SELECT * FROM view;", it's possible that a cursor is returned. A cursor is like an iterator in C++, or an object that enables traversal over a set of results (but is not actually a representation of those results).

To test what the queries were actually executing, I timed "SELECT * FROM foo", "SELECT SUM(CAST(COLUMNS(*) AS INT)) FROM FOO;", and "SELECT * FROM FOO" and fetched the dataframes. Using the Enabling Profiling PRAGMA, I was able to get the timed breakdown for different parts of the query execution. The utility of running a SUM function as a test was to force the program to scan every single piece of data. 

The Projection and Sequential Scan steps were around the same for all three queries, indicating that just SELECT * FROM view; does in fact scan all the data. 

Using the EXPLAIN keyword, I was also able to see the query plans for each query. These are the sequential steps that DuckDB takes to execute the query. Database engines create an optimized uery plan to run a query most efficiently, so the steps of execution are not always obvious.


For example: `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM VIEW;`

So I finally finished benchmarking! And I feel like I'm finally over (at least one) learning curve of the project.
