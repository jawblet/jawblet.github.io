## About Me

I'm pursuing an MS in Computer Science from Columbia University through the Bridge program with an expected graduation date of May 2024. Before Columbia, I worked in Product at a software company and got my BA from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019. I'm from Wynenewood, PA and currently live in Brooklyn, NY. 

I'm interested in distributed systems, software optimization, and network programming. I also enjoy biking, swimming, finding hot springs, and the television show Survivor.  

## About My Advisor

[Eugene Wu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/) is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. His primary research areas are database systems, data interface development & generation, and query explanation.

## About My Project

I'm working on FaDE (**Fa**st **D**eletion **E**valuation), a query explanation engine for aggregate query results. FaDE offers explanations for user-generated questions by generating predicates that explain the result the user is interested at interactive speeds. My goal is to generate interventions, or counterfactual data deletetions, which will be evaluted to see if they result in the expected answer. As the number of interventions is combinatorial, optimizing the generation is a key challenge of my work.
